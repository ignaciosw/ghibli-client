Notes on commits:

Sunday June 10th
First commit. A skeleton of my typical Backbone application, with empty Collections, Models and Views.
Also added the routes for each view, and the empty template files.
A config file was added providing API url and endpoints.
Added a header template with the studio logo.
The application by default has a feature that brings the browser to the homepage every X minutes after no clicks. The timeout can be set in the config file under assets/config/global.conf

No special coding yet, that should come later this week.

ToDo: add routes/views/collections/templates for producers and directors
